  abstract = {This capstone project was the culmination of the CMU SURE 2024 Bridges to Healthcare Technology Program in partnership with UnitedHealth Group. Our project was focused on the impact of adult health-related practices on juvenile health outcomes. We primarily analyzed the impact of adult health behaviors like drinking, smoking, and insufficient sleep on the child mortality rate and low birthweight percentage on a county level. Our modeling consisted of regularization techniques (lasso and ridge regression) and linear regression for predicting low birthweight as well as a decision tree to predict outcomes of child mortality.},

  abstract = {As part of the Space Systems Optimization Group at Georgia Tech,
   I conduct research on optimizing Mars rover surface routing to support energy-efficient and autonomous exploration. 
   The core of this work involves formulating a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model that incorporates elevation-based terrain costs to minimize energy. 
   To ensure feasible and continuous paths, I implemented subtour elimination constraints that prevent disconnected or looping routes. I am extending this model to account for the stochastic nature of orbital satellite data, which introduces uncertainty in terrain information. This involves developing adaptive planning techniques that allow the rover to update its route based on newly observed conditions (local routing/global routing). The overall objective is to improve mission robustness and operational autonomy for long-duration planetary exploration.},
