<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a rising 3rd-year undergraduate at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](http://gatech.edu) pursuing a B.S. in [Industrial & Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/), specializing in [Operations Research](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/academics/undergraduate/degrees/operations-research) with a minor in [Computer Science](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/) (concentration in artificial intelligence/machine learning). I am passionate about optimization and data science.

I am also involved in undergraduate research with the [Space Systems Optimization Group](https://ssog.ae.gatech.edu/), where I am advised by [Prof. Koki Ho](https://ae.gatech.edu/directory/person/koki-ho).

In addition to my academic and research work, I serve as an associate for the [GT Angel Network](https://gtangelnetwork.com), helping lead Georgia Techâ€™s first angel investment network.
